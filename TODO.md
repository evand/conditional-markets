# Conditional Markets Viewer - TODO

Items to do. Add freely, delete when done (move to Completed.md if it was significant).

**Usage**: Keep it messy. One-liners are fine. Delete aggressively. If you're spending more than 30 seconds writing a TODO, you're overdoing it.

## Next Up
- [ ] Limit order detection/warning (affects validation accuracy)
- [ ] Validate before live trade and abort / "trade anyway?"

## Future
- [ ] Security audit for API key handling (basic review done, localStorage approach is reasonable)
- [ ] Generate list of all 2x2 markets on Manifold?
- [ ] Ternary market support (A/~A/Other)
- [ ] higher outcome count market support e.g. will-the-us-attack-a-nato-member-an
- [ ] Mutual information / phi coefficient display
- [ ] Multi-bet API for atomic execution (reduces slippage, but sizes differ)
