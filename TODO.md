# Conditional Markets Viewer - TODO

Items to do. Add freely, delete when done (move to Completed.md if it was significant).

**Usage**: Keep it messy. One-liners are fine. Delete aggressively. If you're spending more than 30 seconds writing a TODO, you're overdoing it.

## Next Up
- [ ] User-defined slugs
      Enter any market slug, manually map 4 outcomes to grid cells

## Future
- [ ] Security audit for API key handling
- [ ] Add warning about alpha / minimally tested software

- [ ] Expected value calculator
